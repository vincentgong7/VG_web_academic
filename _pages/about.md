Using social media data, such as Twitter and Instagram, I identify relevant information, develop data models, estimate and analyse crowds’ characteristics in city events, including demographic and city-role composition, Spatial-temporal distribution, sentiment estimation, Points of Interest preferences, word use, crowd size and density estimation, which help crowd managers make better decisions.

In this website, you can find my CV below, and the summary of my research in the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) section.
